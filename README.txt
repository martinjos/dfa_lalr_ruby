This is one of those bugs that bites me from time to time.

I find myself wanting to design my own parser/compiler for something.

Then I decide I don't like any of the available parser/compiler frameworks, and
I want to design one of my own.

For some reason, I decide recursive descent is too wimpish. (even though it's
used by GCC now...)

Well, that's not the point. If you're going to do it yourself, you might as
well bite the bullet and do it the hardest way possible.

:)

And yes, I know Ruby has things like String#scan, but that's NFA, dammit!
Non-deterministic Finite Automata. If people have gone to all sorts of lengths
to make DFAs optimal and Deterministic, there must be something in it! (maybe
50-odd years ago, I know...)

And yes, it's true, I haven't checked to see whether there already is something
like this out there for Ruby. Except that I know there is at least one
NFA/recursive-descent based framework already (TreeTop). Which is probably
perfectly fine for any conceivable purpose. I'm just insane.

Seriously, this isn't really finished. It needs a good facade or two built
around it, and then a couple of command-line tools perhaps...
